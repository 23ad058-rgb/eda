## Project Overview  
This repository contains a case-study project titled **“Student Performance of Theory and Practical Examination”**.  
The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student dataset, build a prediction model (using PyTorch) and generate insights that can help improve academic performance.

## Objective  
- Conduct EDA on a dataset with 15+ features related to student performance (study time, failures, absences, etc.).  
- Visualize key relationships and patterns using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, etc.  
- Preprocess the data: handle missing values, duplicates, encoding and scaling.  
- Build a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to classify whether a student will pass or fail.  
- Evaluate and visualize model performance: loss curves, accuracy, confusion matrix.
